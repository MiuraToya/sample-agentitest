The next step is to wait for the page to load after clicking the sign-in button. Then, I need to check for the 'Todo List' heading. Since the 'Sign In' button is not explicitly listed as an interactive element with an index, I will assume that clicking the last element (index 8, which is 'Sign Up' but likely acts as a submit button in this context, or there's an implicit submit on the form) has already been done. I need to wait for the page to load and then check for the 'Todo List' heading. The current page is the login page. After signing in, I expect to be redirected to a new page. I will use `wait` to pause execution and then `find_text` to look for the 'Todo List' heading." evaluation_previous_goal='Successfully entered email and password and clicked the sign-in button.
