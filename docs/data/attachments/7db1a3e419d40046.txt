thinking="The agent has scrolled down the page three times, but the 'Delete' button for 'タスクB' is still not visible. The `browser_state` indicates that there are no more pages to scroll (`0.0 pages below`, `1.0 total pages`). This means the element is either not present, or it's not visible even at the bottom of the page. The current `browser_state` shows 'タスクC' and its 'Delete' button (index 8), but not 'タスクB'. Since the goal is to delete 'タスクB' and verify 'タスクA' and 'タスクC' remain, and 'タスクB' is not visible, I cannot proceed with deleting it. I need to re-evaluate if 'タスクB' was actually added or if there's a display issue. Given the previous steps successfully added 'タスクA', 'タスクB', and 'タスクC', it's likely a display issue or the delete button for 'タスクB' is not rendered. Since I cannot find the delete button for 'タスクB' and have exhausted scrolling options, I will assume that the task cannot be completed as described due to the element not being present or visible. I will call `done` with `success=false` and explain the situation." evaluation_previous_goal="Scrolled down the page one more time to ensure I am at the absolute bottom, and then examine the screenshot to locate the 'Delete' button for 'タスクB'. Verdict: Success" memory="Logged in, navigated to the Todo page, and added 'タスクA', 'タスクB', and 'タスクC'. Scrolled down the page three times, but the 'Delete' button for 'タスクB' is not visible, and the page indicates no further scrolling is possible. The current visible todo is 'タスクC' with its delete button." next_goal="The 'Delete' button for 'タスクB' could not be found after scrolling to the bottom of the page. Therefore, the task cannot be completed as requested. I will call done."
