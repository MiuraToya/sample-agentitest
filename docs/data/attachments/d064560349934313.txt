thinking='The previous step successfully added the todo item \'一時的なタスク\' and clicked the \'Add\' button. The current browser state shows \'No todos yet. Add one above!\', which indicates that the todo item was not added to the list, or it was added and then immediately deleted. This contradicts the previous action of clicking \'Add\'. The user\'s request states: "Wait for it to appear in the list. Then click the \'Delete\' button next to \'一時的なタスク\'. Confirm that \'No todos yet\' message is displayed." Since the \'No todos yet\' message is already displayed, it implies that the todo item was not added successfully, or it was added and deleted in a way that is not visible to me. I need to re-evaluate the state and determine the next course of action. Given the current state, it seems the \'Add\' action did not result in the todo appearing in the list. Therefore, I cannot proceed to delete it. I should check if the todo item is actually present. If it is not, I should try adding it again. However, the current state shows \'No todos yet\', which means I cannot click a delete button next to \'一時的なタスク\'. I will assume that the previous \'Add\' action failed to add the item to the list, and the \'No todos yet\' message is accurate. Therefore, I cannot proceed with deleting the item. I need to re-attempt adding the todo item. If it appears, I can then delete it. If it doesn\'t appear again, I will have to conclude that there is an issue with the application\'s functionality. For now, I will try to add the todo item again and then look for it to delete.' evaluation_previous_goal="The previous step successfully added the todo item '一時的なタスク' and clicked the 'Add' button, but the page now shows 'No todos yet', indicating the item did not appear in the list as expected.
