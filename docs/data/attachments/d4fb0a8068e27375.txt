thinking="The previous step attempted to add 'タスクB' to the todo list. The action result indicates that the input was successful, but the subsequent click on the 'Add' button was not executed because something new appeared on the page. This suggests that the page might have reloaded or updated after the input, and the 'Add' button's state or index might have changed, or new elements appeared that interrupted the action sequence. The current browser state shows that 'タスクA' is already in the list, and the input field (element 6) still contains 'タスクB'. The 'Add' button is element 7. I need to re-attempt clicking the 'Add' button (element 7) to add 'タスクB'. After that, I will add 'タスクC', then delete 'タスクB', and finally verify the list." evaluation_previous_goal="Partially successful.
