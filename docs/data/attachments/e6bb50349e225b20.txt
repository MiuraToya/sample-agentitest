The goal is to delete 'タスクB' and then verify that 'タスクA' and 'タスクC' remain. Since 'タスクC' is visible, it's likely that 'タスクB' is also visible or was visible before scrolling. I need to locate the 'Delete' button associated with 'タスクB'. The current screenshot shows 'タスクC' and its delete button. I need to scroll down further to find 'タスクB' and its delete button. After deleting 'タスクB', I will need to verify the remaining items." evaluation_previous_goal="Scrolled down the page to find the 'Delete' button for 'タスクB'.
