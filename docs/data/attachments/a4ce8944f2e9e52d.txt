The current page shows 'タスクC' and a 'Delete' button next to it. I need to find the 'Delete' button for 'タスクB' and click it. After that, I will need to verify that 'タスクA' and 'タスクC' are still present and 'タスクB' is gone. Finally, I will return 'partial_delete_ok'.\n\nLooking at the current browser state, I see 'タスクC' and a 'Delete' button with index 8. I need to find the 'Delete' button associated with 'タスクB'. Since 'タスクB' was added before 'タスクC', its delete button should be before index 8. However, the current view only shows 'タスクC' and its delete button. I will scroll down to see if 'タスクB' and its delete button are visible." evaluation_previous_goal="Successfully added 'タスクC' to the todo list.
