thinking="The previous steps successfully added 'タスクA', 'タスクB', and 'タスクC' to the todo list. I have scrolled down twice, but I still don't see the 'Delete' button for 'タスクB'. The current page state shows that there are 0.0 pages above and 0.0 pages below, and 1.0 total pages. This indicates that I am already at the bottom of the page. I need to re-evaluate if the delete button is visible or if there's another way to interact with it. Since I've scrolled as much as possible and still don't see the delete button, I should check the screenshot to see if it's present but not interactive, or if it's simply not there. If it's not there, I might need to reconsider how to delete 'タスクB'. However, the prompt implies the delete button should be present. Given the current state, I will attempt to scroll down again, just in case the page rendering is lagging, and then I will examine the screenshot to confirm the visibility of the delete button for 'タスクB'. If it's still not visible, I will need to consider alternative strategies or report an issue." evaluation_previous_goal="Scrolled down the page again to find the 'Delete' button for 'タスクB'.
