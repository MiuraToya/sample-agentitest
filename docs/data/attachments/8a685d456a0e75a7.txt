I have already navigated to the URL, entered the credentials, and clicked the sign-in button. The current state shows that the login page is still visible, and the input fields have the values I entered. The next logical step is to wait for the page to load after clicking the sign-in button and then check for the 'Todo List' heading. Since the previous actions were to input text and click the sign-in button, I should now wait for the page to potentially load and then check for the heading. The user explicitly asked to 'Wait for the page to load' after signing in. I will use a wait action for a few seconds and then check for the heading. If the heading is not visible, I will need to investigate further. If it is visible, I will call done." evaluation_previous_goal='Successfully entered credentials and clicked the sign-in button.
