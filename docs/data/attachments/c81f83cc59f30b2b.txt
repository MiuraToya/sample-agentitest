thinking="The previous step successfully logged in the user. The next step is to navigate to the 'Todo' page, add three todos, and then delete one. The current page is the login page, and the user has successfully entered credentials and clicked 'Sign In'. The browser state shows that the login was successful and the user is now on the login page, but the page content indicates that the login action has been completed, and the user is still on the login page. This suggests that the login might have failed or the page did not redirect as expected. However, the user request states to wait for the page to load after clicking 'Sign In', implying a successful login and redirection. I need to verify if the login was successful and if I am on the correct page to proceed with adding todos. The current URL is https://d214my39l3yw2c.cloudfront.net/login. The user request implies a redirection to a 'Todo' page. I should check if the 'Todo' link is available and if I am on the correct page. The available elements show a 'Todo' link with index 4. I will click on it to navigate to the Todo page." evaluation_previous_goal="Successfully entered credentials and clicked 'Sign In'.
