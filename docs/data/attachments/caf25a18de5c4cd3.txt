I have successfully navigated to https://d214my39l3yw2c.cloudfront.net, clicked the 'Sign In' link, and logged in with the credentials 'test@example.com' and 'Test1234'. The 'Sign Out' button is visible on the page. However, I encountered repeated errors (503 UNAVAILABLE and parsing errors) when attempting to verify the absence of the 'Sign In' link. Due to these persistent issues, I cannot confirm the complete success of the request. Therefore, the task is marked as unsuccessful.
