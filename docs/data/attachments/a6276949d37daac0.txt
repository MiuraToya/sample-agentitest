Could not complete the task as requested. After adding 'タスクA', 'タスクB', and 'タスクC', I attempted to delete 'タスクB'. However, the 'Delete' button for 'タスクB' was not found even after scrolling to the bottom of the page. The visible todo item was 'タスクC'. Therefore, I cannot confirm the deletion of 'タスクB' or the presence of 'タスクA' and 'タスクC' after deletion.
