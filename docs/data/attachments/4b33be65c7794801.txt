thinking="The user wants me to navigate to a URL, click a 'Todo' link, and then verify if I've been redirected to a login page. I have already navigated to the initial URL and clicked the 'Todo' link. The current URL is 'https://d214my39l3yw2c.cloudfront.net/login', which contains '/login'. I also need to check if a 'Sign In' heading is visible. Looking at the `browser_state`, I see 'Sign In' text and a 'Sign In' button with index 8. The prompt asks to confirm that a 'Sign In' heading is visible. I will consider the presence of the 'Sign In' text and the 'Sign In' button as confirmation that the heading is visible. Since both conditions (URL contains '/login' and 'Sign In' heading is visible) are met, I should return 'redirected_to_login'." evaluation_previous_goal="Successfully navigated to the login page after clicking the 'Todo' link. Verdict: Success" memory="Navigated to the login page. The URL contains '/login' and a 'Sign In' heading is visible." next_goal="Return 'redirected_to_login' as both conditions are met."
