thinking="The previous login attempt failed, as indicated by the login form still being visible. The current page state shows a 'Sign Out' button (index 5) and no 'Sign In' link, which contradicts the expectation that the login failed. This suggests that the login might have been successful despite the form remaining visible, or there's a misunderstanding of the page state. The user's request is to confirm that 'Sign Out' is visible and 'Sign In' is not. Since 'Sign Out' is visible and 'Sign In' is not, the condition is met. Therefore, I should return 'sign_out_visible'." evaluation_previous_goal='The previous login attempt failed, as the login form was still visible. Verdict: Failure' memory="Attempted to log in with provided credentials, but the login page remained visible. The 'Sign Out' button is now visible, and the 'Sign In' link is not present." next_goal="The 'Sign Out' button is visible and the 'Sign In' link is not, fulfilling the user's request. I should now terminate the task and return the result."
