thinking="The user wants me to navigate to a URL, click 'About', confirm the URL, click 'Home', and confirm the heading. I have already navigated to the URL and clicked 'About' multiple times in previous steps. The last step was to click 'Home'. I need to verify if the current page is the home page and if the 'Welcome to SampleApp' heading is present. The current URL is https://d214my39l3yw2c.cloudfront.net/. The visible elements include 'Home' (index 2), 'About' (index 3), 'Todo' (index 4), 'Sign In' (index 5), and the heading 'Welcome to SampleApp'. This indicates I am back on the home page. Therefore, both navigations were successful. I should now return 'navigation_works'." evaluation_previous_goal="Successfully navigated to the initial URL, clicked 'About', and confirmed the URL contains '/about'.
