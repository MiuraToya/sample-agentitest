The last action was clicking the 'Sign In' button. The current browser state shows that the login page is still displayed, and the input fields still contain the entered credentials. This indicates that the login was likely unsuccessful, or the page did not navigate as expected after the sign-in attempt. I need to check if the page has changed to the 'Todo' page as requested by the user. Since the current page is still the login page, I should assume the login failed and re-evaluate the next steps. The user request states 'Wait for the page to load. On the Todo page, type '買い物に行く' in the input field and click 'Add'. Confirm that '買い物に行く' appears in the todo list.' Since I am not on the Todo page, I need to first figure out why the login failed or if there's another way to get to the Todo page. Given the current state, I should try to navigate to the Todo page directly, as the login might be broken or not the intended path to the Todo page." evaluation_previous_goal='The login attempt did not result in navigation to the Todo page, indicating a potential issue with the login process or credentials.
